STATUS.txt (latest on top, future at bottom)

Feb 2, 2018 - ESC now kills hard loop.

Jan 9, 2018 - BUG in library's random(little,big). Returns -1 often. Flaw is arithmetic. Big positive (110M+) pushed. % operator pops -20.

Jan 7, 2018 - Tidied the files. Moved much material into two new folders: SamplePrograms, and Archive. Added 'the new classical tiny-C.docx' file which gathers material from scattered txt files and presents it in a more readable fashion. 

Dec 19, 2017 - pf.tc runs fine. Helped find a few bugs, PLUS many improvements to the debugger. Documentation on all is coming next.

Nov 24, 2017 - First big test, pf.tc. Not working well, finding bugs.

Nov 21, 2017 - A useful debugger. Classical lib needs file i/o, and unbuffered getchar. Need doc, i.e. a new OM.

Nov 15, 2017 - All lib except the file i/o. Everything is now in the master branch. Started work on a simple debugger, but that is a WIP. It compiles and links and will not interfere with usage.

Nov 7, 2017 - More lib: scann, index, countch. Also whatHappened (user friendly diagnostic). BIG DEAL: integrated gedit using its external tools. Instead of pps we now have a nice wysiwyg editor.

Nov  1, 2017 - more Classical Library stuff (ceqn, scann)

Oct 30, 2017 - The Classical branch (not uploaded yet) will be updates to the classical library. Currently master branch has  putchar, getchar, pft, gs, ps, pl, alpha, num, atoi

Oct 30, 2017 - I plan to describe my development environment. This may help others interested in porting to different environments.

Oct 28, 2017 - The master branch has a command line version of tiny-c. 
	$ ./tc<ret>   will print Usage.
