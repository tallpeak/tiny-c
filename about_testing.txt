As of this writing there are 42 unit tests organized for simple regession testing. The are numbered 1 up. Most are coded completely in the file test.c, but a few use files stored in the directory testFiles. 
To run tests
	./test [<testnumber> ...]
With test numbers just those tests are run. If none are given ALL tests are run. The test results are printed to stdout. This is useful for just one or a few tests.
A more convenient way to run all tests is...
	make dotest
which produces a file, test_results. Follow that with...
	make diff
which diffs test_results against good_results to stdout. I do not redirect that but let it print to my terminal. Then scroll up/down to find issues. Every test prints a header like...
	TEST 40  14:12
which includes a time stamp. So the different time stamps for good_results vs test_results diff will always cause both headers to print...
	TEST 40  14:12
	TEST 40  12:32
The times themselves are irrelevant. Actual result differences ARE relevant, and this simple trick identifies which test needs attention. After doing a make diff scroll up and down and if all is cool it takes 5 seconds to determine that.
