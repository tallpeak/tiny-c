arr2d.tc

Goal: View an array as a matrix. 
The first two cells capture the dimensions, thus making the array self
defining. The array size must therefore be at least 2+rows*cols.
Usage: 
  Declare an array, and call mat_setup to initialize it as an array.
Then typically only mat_set and mat_val need be used in an application.
The other functions may be useful, so look them over. 
  A set of convenient functions are in the block comment at the end. 
Uncover these (and maybe edit the names) to simplify usage.

[Note: later changed from mat to arr2d]
