My environment
---
I built this version of tinyC on mint linux using these tools:
    - gnu's c compiler, gcc ubuntu 4.8.4-2
    - gnu's make 3.81, makefile
The makefile has all the technical specs. For example this line...
    CFLAGS = -w -g -ansi -I /usr/lib/syslinux/com32/include/
defines all the dash flags used on each compile/link.

One anomoly. Two files would not compile with those flags, I don't know why...
    - time.c
    - FileRead.c
But they compile and work fine with NO flags except -c, just pure 'gcc -c time.c', for example. And the link phase found their objects just fine.

I am not familiar with either windows, or apples OSx. I assume they have build facilities not too far removed from my supplied make. So if you are porting my work to another environment you may have a bit of work to port the makefile, especially the compile flags.

GOOD LUCK!
