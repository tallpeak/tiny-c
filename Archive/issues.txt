736:	8 pm:	 read section 2.10 of owners manual, private MC's. Interesting. 
ISSUE:	 it describes MC calling in detail, specifically MCESET and USERMC stubs. Need to do those. ASM ~2198,2232.

3135:	Writing debug.txt. Here are ISSUEs uncovered by the writing...
	debug r should offer restart
	debug disable and enable
	prbegin never called, should be AFTER link, so can set brkpts
		goaround: do one n. That lets interp run until it has to parse a statement, which is the MAIN_. By then link is done and you can enter bkpt's.
	debug b, sym must be canonical form
		canonical not called
		adding long sym using long name fails. Adding using canon'd result (mentally achieved) works.

3883:	ISSUE:	 in gdb caught in the (tc-db) command loop. Not getting prompt, cannot g or c or anything. Not sure how to get into the loop

Is this an ISSUE ???  YES, the arrow keys become accidental ESC's
	Test 92 shows this
	macnine call ~125; also tc.c ~840
	Test 92, the arrow keys use ESC [ <code> 
	A	up,	B	down,	C	right,	D	left	
	BUT the esc sets a kill! 
	MC2 (test 91) doesn't do that. Must be in the lib code.
