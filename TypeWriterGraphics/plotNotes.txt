x	1 - separate the infrastructure from the actual drawings and tests.
x	2 - That implys a makefile to put stuff together.

	4 - objects.c with line,circle,rectangle,etc.
	5 - Add interactive drawing, saving, etc.
	6 - Define a tc library that supports this type of drawing.
	7 - A bash utility to produce jpeg/gif/png copies
