STATUS: plot.c has two drawings, test and star. Its main has a few - options, e.g. which to draw, and for star how many points.
GOALs:
	0 - Usage
x	1 - separate the infrastructure from the actual drawings and tests.
x	2 - That implys a makefile to put stuff together.
	3 - Problem space layer above plot below objects
	4 - objects.c with line,circle,rectangle,etc.
	5 - Add interactive drawing, saving, etc.
	6 - Define a tc library that supports this type of drawing.
	7 - A bash utility to produce jpeg/gif/png copies
