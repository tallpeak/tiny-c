Plot notes

Started 1/14/2018
STATUS: plot.c has two drawings, test and star. Its main has a few - options, e.g. which to draw, and for star how many points.
GOALs:
x	0 - Usage
x	1 - separate the infrastructure from the actual drawings and tests.
x	2 - That implys a makefile to put stuff together.
x	3 - Problem space layer above plot below objects
	4 - objects.c with 
x		line,
x		circle,
		rectangle,
			all independant of palette
	5 - better way to pick what to draw.
		command line palette
		
	6 - Add interactive drawing, saving, etc.
	7 - Define a tc library that supports this type of drawing.
	8 - A bash utility to produce jpeg/gif/png copies

Still debugging.
FIXED. 
New issue: added code to plot() to label diag's "new object" to relieve object code of that issue.

Still debugging.
Now using makefile. Also gdb.

mirrored line issue FIXED. 
Starting work on Problem Space (#3 above).
Git: Commit. Push, too. Need to 'make clean' before commits.
Working on palette. test.c modified for 0011 pallette.
	"Invalid space" Dumps all 0.0 space size.

FIXED. palette(..) doesn't initialize. 
DONE. Line needs work.
changes...
	New function palette(..) defines problem coordinates.
	The old plot(..) is now plot_basic(..), int args as always.
	The new plot has floats as arguments, maps to int args for plot_basic.
	Points now take floats as elelments.
	line(..) now uses floats from Points, and all calcs.
	void test() defines 5 lines using 10 Points, 
		all floating point, on a palette(0,0,1,1).
	User API so far:
		palette, plot, line. All floating point.

REFACTORING thoughts: The way to organize this is to do raw forms of circle and star, in a file called rawObj, I guess. Then objects.c just does maps into their corresponding raw. That way raw is what we put into a tc plot library. And main is outside all.
And a better name for all is picaGraphics. Maybe raw becomes pg prefix.
How to do the pts array? It has to be raw. So it is pgPts[]? How to do JUST a point?

pgObjects.c defines integer only pgPlot(int,int) and pgLine(pgPoint,pgPoint). pgPlot.h is header. pgTest.c has main and test(), 5 lines so far. pgObjects defines all basic stuff: 80x80 Space, blank,show,label, pgPlot, pgLine. 
To objects I intend to add circle, and a star(pos,points,radius), all int.
To test I will add the shapes, all on one space.
ISSUES
x	-m is lost
x	-d plot all float 0's
x	-p deprecated as global, still 
x		used globally in test.c
x	- pgStar will use no globals, 
x		ditto pgCircle, 
x		ditto pgPointCircle
	- some evidence lines need half an inc adjust at start. A few spurious dots outside of circle, and line overrun for star.

REFACTORING is done. All work. main is in pgTest. So is test. makefile not needed; tcc *.c -lm -o plot works fine. 
	Small objects plot poorly, large ones look fine.

ISSUE, tests with palatte 0,0,1,1 fine. Same test -1,-1,1,1 bad! The size doubles, should be half. Plot goes off the palette, should be 1st quad. map must be the culprit. * instead of /, offset wrong, too.

Two debug levels -D -d. The former shows low level detail, the latter high level. 
Evidence of lines needing end trimming..
	palette(plot~65) -1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
	Circle center: 0.000000 0.000000 radius: 0.650000 points: 25
	 ...

Using gcc plot is 18.5K, Using tcc its 14.3K. tcc args ok in any order, gcc requires the -lm to be last. Interesting.
	tcc -o plot -lm *.c		OK (but not for gcc)
	tcc -lm -o plot *.c		OK (but not for gcc)
	gcc -o plot *.c -lm		OK
