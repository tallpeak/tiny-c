Millie the Millipede strapped her new GPS watch to her belly and headed
out. She covered 5 mibs in a time of 66 tibs. (A millipede mib is like a
human mile and a millipede tib is like a human minute.)

Her buddy Billy told her he'd heard the folks over at NJTC were C peeps
and they might be able to analyze her run. So she PMd them:

Hi NJTC,

<p>

I want to know my average pace (in tibs per mib), which leg was my
quickest (smallest tibs per mib), and which leg was my slowest. Could
you send me a report?

<p>

I did it manually (this is tough, BTW, when you have no hands and 1000
feet, but I digress).

<p>

Average pace: 13.2 tibs/mib<br>
Quickest leg was leg 4. Pace was 3 tibs/mib.<br>
Slowest leg was leg 2. Pace was 30 tibs/mib.<br>

<p>

My buddy Billy did a 13 mibber yesterday and I would like to give him a similar
report. Can you help him out?

<p>

Thanks a lot!

<p>

Millie
