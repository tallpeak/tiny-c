<p>

In C, write a simulation of cars entering and passing through a four way
intersection.

<p>

Input: average rate of arrival of cars in any direction (e.g. 1
car in 3 time intervals).

<p>

Graphic output:

<p>

For each time unit, show with simple ASCII graphic characters the
intersection, the 4 two way streets (allow up to 5 cars in any single
lane on any single side of the intersection) and the cars.

<p>

Rules:

<p>

1. A car at an intersection can procede through it only if there is no
car on its right. In this simulation cars only go straight through the
intersection.

<p>

2. Cars advance 1 car length per time unit (simulation advances 1 time
unit at a time).
